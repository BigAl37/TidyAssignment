I have merged the test and training data, tidied via various R functions and then produced a single tidy summary file of the mean for the std, mean of the various x values, by the subject and activity.


The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'

- 'Codebook.MD'

- 'tidy.txt'

- 'run_analysis.R'
